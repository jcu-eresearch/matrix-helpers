# Training

## Getting Started

* Login process: how to login
  * Login to your site by going to https://www.jcu.edu.au/playful-learning/_login
  * Once you're logged in, you'll see the Page Tools menu at the top-left
* Conceptual model of the whole system (“files and folders on your computer”)
  * Difference between a Page and a Site (eg where the settings are)
  * Show the Asset Finder window as a demo
  * Add Screenshot explaining where things come from. Or, edit overlay with links (annotate each area in html?)

* How our setup differs from the current JCU environment (for existing
  editors; eg accordions, styles etc)

## Adding new content

* Explain the process of getting new content online (`Page Tools` > `Add new
  content`)
* Creating a blank page
* Template should usually be selected when creating new Pages or Content
Blocks

## Editing

* Add and Edit content and change Settings by using the Page Tools menu of any page
* Explain where certain content comes from: why Content, Details, Settings. (What is “special” and what’s just content)
* Pages are made up of Content Blocks; you can add new Content Blocks to pages and change existing Content Blocks.
  * There are a number of different Templates available for Content Blocks.  Changing a Template changes the appearance & functionality.
* Eye icon -> full page live view
* Get serious about how things look on phones:
    * Enabling Responsive Design View for mobiles/tablets (Firefox: menu —> Developer —> Responsive Design View, Chrome: )
* Images start the asset finder there they're located. You may need to browse to find your site if your original image was located outside of your site. 

## Site Settings

* Social media URLs
* Some settings, such as the background image, can be set for your entire site

## Notes

* Previews aren’t live editing: save first, then preview
* Explain what the brackets mean in navigation
* Publish the training materials via read the docs so editors have offline materials

## Getting help

## Need inspiration?

If you need any more inspiration, take a look through a few of our existing
Web Framework websites, including the following:

* [Orpheus Island Research Station](https://www.jcu.edu.au/orpheus-island)
* [Daintree Rainforest Observatory](https://www.jcu.edu.au/daintree)
* [Fletcherview Research Station](https://www.jcu.edu.au/fletcherview)
* [eResearch Centre](https://www.jcu.edu.au/eresearch)

Even if you're not an editor on any of these sites, once you're logged into
your JCU website, you can take a look at how any site is configured.  To do
this, click `Page Tools` --> `View` and choose the aspect you'd like to see.
