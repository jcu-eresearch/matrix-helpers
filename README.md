# What is The Matrix?

Here's a collection of resources to make your life with the Matrix CMS easier
and make some form of development possible.

## Getting started

To get started, ensure you don't think about Matrix as
a traditional CMS; it is very unopinionated about every aspect of either
content management, creation or configuration.  Expect you need to do
effectively everything yourself in terms of wiring: eg creating templates,
setting up metadata and connecting it all together.
