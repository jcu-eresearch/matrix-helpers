<!--@@ Include the SSJS here - again - because this scope is in a different proccess
when this asset is included via %globals_asset_contents:XXX%.  Works around
https://github.com/jcu-eresearch/matrix-helpers/issues/82, but note that
not everythig can possibly work (such as JS/CSS includes, like for Google Maps).

This whole asset listing could be replaced with SSJS over in default-folder.html Paint Layout
when this is resolved.  @@-->
