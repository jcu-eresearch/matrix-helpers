# Server-side DOM implementation: https://github.com/fgnass/domino
#
# This file was created by doing the following:
#
#    mkdir domino
#    cd domino
#    npm install domino
#    browserify -r domino -s domino -o domino.js
#
# The associated `domino-v8js-shim.js` provides a very basic shim for Domino to
# work within v8js.  As v8 has no `console` object, we provide a basic
# workaround and as v8 has no timers, we bail on any such calls.
#
# After you configure a `window` object, it's also possible to include jQuery
# or any other library, should you need it.
